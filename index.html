        <h3>Cities I have Lived</h3>
        <p>I was born in Oklahoma City.  I moved to Edmon as a child and went to grade school.  
            I moved to live with my Dad in Restin and he shortly after was relocated to Plano.  
            After High School we moved to Allen, but I soon went to college at OU in Norman.  
            After graduation I met my wife at work, and we lived in an Apartment in Addison.  We soon after
            bought our first house in McKinney.  I was transfered to Headquarters in Bloomington, IL.  I, 
            however, moved back to McKinney as fast as I could when we opened up our Dallas Hub in Texas.

        <h3>Cities I would like to visit</h3>
        <p>Prague has always sounded like an amazing place to visit, I especially like old European cities with interesting 
            architecture.  Munich is a top for me as I love German-everything and want to go to Oktoberfest.  Nassau is next
            because I love the Ocean and the Caribbean.
